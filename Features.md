List of Features:

1. ROI (Region of Interest) Marking

    Ability to define two types of ROI: square and point.
    Square ROI can be marked in two ways:
        By dragging the mouse across the screen.
        By marking two opposite corners, allowing the creation of an ROI larger than the visible area.

2. ROI Editing

    The software allows:

   - Naming marked ROIs.
   - Editing the position of a marked ROI by dragging its corners or edges.
   - Modifying measurement parameter guidelines (e.g., scatter).

3. Mosaic Creation

   - Display of ROI on the mosaic.
   - Ability to navigate to a specific point on the mosaic.

4. Camera Control

   - Control over image parameters.
   - Brightness adjustment.
   - Focus control.
   - Zoom operation Selection of one of 10 discrete zoom levels.

5. Sample Position Manipulation

   - Integrated control of the two-axis manipulator holding the sample.

6. Convenience Features

    -  Dynamically scaled ruler based on zoom level, allowing the measurement of object distances on the sample.
    - Measurement of the distance between two points on the sample.
    - Automatic orientation of the sample matrix.
    - Automatic calibration verification.
    - Automatic tilt correction.
    - Autofocus functionality.
    - Automatic zeroing of the manipulator.
    - Export of the currently viewed image.
    - Export of ROI along with the associated images.
    - Automatic positioning of the manipulator for mounting/unmounting the sample matrix.

7. Applied Corrections to Improve Measurement

    - Tilt Correction: Adjusts for any tilt in the sample to ensure accurate measurements.
    - Rotation Correction: Corrects any misalignment in the sample's rotation.
    - Wobble Correction: Compensates for inconsistencies in the sample's movement or positioning.
    - Sample Position Correction: Ensures the sample is precisely positioned for accurate measurement.
